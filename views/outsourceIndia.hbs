          <p> The outsourcing phenomenon has picked up momentum only in the past decade with the
            advent of the internet. Ever since undersea fiber -optic cables have been laid out,
            it has helped in boosting internet connectivity across continents. Cheap access
            to the worldwide web has helped in the growth and evolution of a knowledge economy
            which has resulted in a redistribution of wealth across the globe. The wave of outsourcing
            became a flood when sending large amounts of data through the internet to another
            corner of the world became a breeze.<br/>

            Outsourcing is not new for the country like India. It was started dates back during
            1960s. Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) is the long-term contracting out of non-core
            business processes to an outside provider to help achieve increased shareholder
            value. BPO saves precious management time and resources and allows focus while building
            upon core competencies. After BPO, India has now set its sights on becoming a global
            hub for knowledge process outsourcing (KPO). Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO),
            a new terminology is evolved for the business related to the patents and intellectual
            property.<br/>

            As India has the second largest English speaking scientific manpower pool in the
            world after the U.S. most of the Global competitors are looking forward to India
            to outsource their IPR needs related to patent searching, prior art search, infringement
            and validity search etc,. Companies in the western world realized that sending work
            offshore proved to be a profitable proposition as the response was even faster than
            vendors based in the home country.<br/>
            <br/>
            Today, India can be called as the world's outsourcing hub. India has been a pioneer
            in providing outsourcing solutions and has been providing a range of outsourcing
