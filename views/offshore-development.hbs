          <p> Technology is a wide arena, like our outer space in the galaxy. IT outsourcing isn't
            much different than any other kind of outsourcing. Offshore software development
            is something that more and more software development companies are looking into.
            Like anything in business, there are benefits as well as drawbacks to offshore software
            development. Each company has to determine for themselves whether the benefits outweigh
            the drawbacks. Anyone who has experience in outsourcing knows that there are advantages
            as well as disadvantages in offshore software development.</p>

          Software outsourcing gathered strength with increasing number of sources available
          in present IT-edge, requirements delivery in possible least time, less skilled personnel
          available, discrete communication and inefficient management of various modules
          within a large enterprise. These corporate players started looking and relying on
          third party for better management at lesser cost and remain competitive in the global
          marketplace. These are the few factors that led big companies to outsource their
          software application development to offshore companies where they find time zone
          difference from eastern countries most attractive, cheaper human capital, rich resources,
          and skilled professional and low processes cost. Market analysis shows gradual penetration
          of investors in Indian market and other developing countries.<br>

          <p> One should remember that software development methodologies are all milestones in
            the continuing evolution of software engineering. This evolution is still continuing
            and there will be more variants in the future. And, depending upon the nature of
            the software development project, the choice needs to be different. A compatible
            Process Methodology accelerates the delivery of high quality custom software. An
            Agile Process Methodology follows a controlled, iterative development and prototyping
            process.</p>
